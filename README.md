# INFO 201 A0 Data Visualization report 
Patricia Ma, Jan 21st, 2022

### Summary 
In these two data visualizations that I found, the primary one represents the average GPA for the INFO 201 course throughout the years which I found on a student-built site called UW Course Finder (https://course-finder-a3244.web.app/gradeHistory/courseCode=INFO+201). It showcased the overall grades distribution in percentage - the average for this course seems to be quite high. The secondary visualization is a scatter plot that illustrates the distribution and some correlation between University of Washington admission/denial decision and applicants' GPA and standardized test grades based on applicants' self-reported data. It was used in the context to supplement acceptance rate and application requirement explanations.  (https://www.thoughtco.com/washington-gpa-sat-act-data-786744#)

### Description 
In my primary data visualization, we see a left skewed distribution for INFO 201's historical average GPA. As it shows on the graph: About 50.6% of the students walked away with an A, 31% of the students received an A- grade, and we see a much lower percentage of students getting somewhere between B+ and D across the board with a few outlying withdrawals on the right side, perhaps due to lack of interest in the course content. Users can also customize their search above the graph on the page to see the GPA result for a specific quarter or under a particular instructor. 

### Primary data visualization break-down

**Who**: Two UW students Zyad Elgohary & Khalid Elhousieny built this course finder site to help current students research on classes. 

**Date**: Last updated: August 27th, 2021

**Stakeholders**: The stakeholders in this case are students of the University of Washington who are looking for the right courses to take; students who are looking for comprehensive data on the average final grade of a particular course or under a certain professor; those who would like to know the grades distribution -- overall how many percentage of the class gets an A, B,C or D to access the course difficulty and workload.

**Interests**: The information and data visualization ton this website is extremely valuable to all UW student for the course and grades ***transparency*** it provides. 
With this application, students no longer need to go ask their professors, friends or online about their desired information about course grades. Professors can also use this tool to visualize student's performance in different quarters throughout the years to evaluate their teaching results and make appropriate adjustments. 
_It's a one-stop information station_.

**Key fact**: With this visualization, students are provided with information like course mean and median and they should know exactly what to expect in a course. It removes any suspense of unknown grade curves in some weed-out classes; it helps students pick a professor to see who's students do relatively better overall grade wise.

By doing this assignment, I first learned how to look for data visualizations, and I also learned how to look deeper into the context of the graphs I found to analyze their purposes. I realized it was important to look at the all the aforementioned bullet points when looking at a data set of visualization: 

  * Who - this tells us who developed this dataset, and can help us further analyze their good/harmful intention
  * Date - this tells us if the data we're looking at is up to date
  * Stakeholders - this tells us the demographics we are addressing by analyzing these data. Who are we helping? 
  * Interests - this tells us why this research/data exists in the first place. Is there a lack of service in this area? 
  * Key fact - this is our ultimate take away from this service 

It's important to analyze what we're seeing on the internet these days before quoting and using them directly because there are so much information available to us and it's our responsibility to select useful and well-coordinated ones.
